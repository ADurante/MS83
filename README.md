## <a id="1"></a>Premise

The prototype can be printed in complete autonomy, if you have a *3D printer* and you are practical, with the method of **additive manufacturing** or printed by those who provide this type of printing services, using the file in *STL* ("STereoLithography") format that I have released in this *[repository](https://github.com/ADurante/MS83 "MS83 repository")*. Here in the documentation is referred to the material **recommended** to make it, along with the characteristics and other informations relating to the same.

**Always remember that it is a prototype in experimental phase and, as such, it does not provide any guarantee, nor I assume any responsibility for any problems arising from its use.**

## <a id="3"></a>Description

**MS83 Ears Support for Mask** (henceforth "**MS83**") is a prototype designed and developed to be a support for the *ear cups* when wearing *face masks*, but this is not the only purpose to which it aims. The **MS83** has in its concept elements such as simplicity, immediacy of use, versatility and the least invasiveness possible, all this not at the expense of its aesthetics. It looks like a fine device, with a clean line and very versatile. It aims to perform the following tasks:

- eliminate weight bearing on the cartilage of the *ear cups*;
- hold the *face mask* firmly in place, without allowing it to drop downward;
- assist in the proper use of the *face mask*;
- to alleviate the discomfort and inconvenience associated with the use of *face masks* in general, always promoting their correct use.

## <a id="4"></a>History

The name of the prototype is also a reference to the anime series "[Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_0083:_Stardust_Memory "Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory Wikipedia")" by [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiyuki_Tomino "Yoshiyuki Tomino Wikipedia"), produced by the Japanese animation studio [Sunrise](https://www.sunrise-inc.co.jp/international/ "Sunrise International's Official Website"). Very briefly, **Mobile Suits** are large combat robots, for military use, known for their **support** during warfare. This, gives me the cue for the name of the prototype and its "warfare" along with the *face masks* that are one of the main "weapons" used to counter the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19 Wikipedia") (COronaVIrus Disease 2019).

## <a id="5"></a>Ways of use

Let's start from the fact that there is not only one way to use the support correctly, but it varies a lot from one subject to another, according to the anatomical characteristics of each of us and to the comfort. Even, you could think of "bypassing" the *ear cups*, hooking the *elastic* so that they pass either just below or just above it (**recommended**).

## <a id="6"></a>Support measures

- Length: *120.00 mm*
- Width: *20.00 mm*
- Height: *10.30 mm*

**Hooks**

- Length: *12.04mm*

## <a id="7"></a>Material v1

The material used and recommended to make the first version of the prototype for daily use in **low risk of contamination** environments was [BIOFLEX Antibacterial by FILOALFA®](https://www.filoalfa3d.com/gb/content/43-bioflex-Antibacterial "BIOFLEX Antibacterial's Link"). Below are the main features:

- Flexible and Durable (**35 sh/D**);
- Pleasant to the touch;
- Bacterial reduction **>80%** (**Gram+**/**Gram-**) and tested according to *ISO 846* standard;
- Suitable for medical certification;
- Can be in contact with food according to *Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011*;
- Does not contain metal ions or release any element in nano or micro form in water.

## <a id="8"></a>Material v2

The material used to make the latest version of the prototype is [FILOFlex by FILOALFA® Soft](https://www.filoalfa3d.com/gb/content/25-filoflex "FILOFlex's Link"). The latter, has been further optimized for **healthcare personnel at high risk from contamination**.

When using the previous **v1**, it was found to be less comfortable to put on with *facial filter* and, after about 20 decontaminations with *70% alcohol-based solution*, the material was starting to fray from the edges, particularly, on the top.

Immediately reviewing the design, a modification was made on the hooks, in addition, the material was also changed using **FILOFlex Soft**. The same had been used in the **v0**, however in the **Medium**. Below are the main features:

- Flexible and Durable (**80 sh/D**);
- High resistance to wear and tear, with maintenance of the degree of elasticity over time;
- Excellent physical characteristics of shock absorption and UV resistance;
- Resistance also to chemical agents (**e.g., wide range of both industrial and non-industrial chemicals**).

As you can guess, the key word of this material, coming from the automotive industry, is "**RESISTANCE**".

## <a id="9"></a>Other materials

The **MS83** prototype can safely be produced from other materials, but it is important that they be *flexible* and *strong*.

## <a id="10"></a>What is the difference with the other supports?

The best *face masks* still seem to be those that clip on behind *ear cups*. So, since the **coronavirus** emergency, people have started printing with the method of **additive manufacturing** several of these supports, more or less well made. Some of them are not available for everyone the printing file and/or I found them very invasive and uncomfortable to use, especially for some elderly people or those who work many hours consecutively wearing them. There are supports that I have defined "fishbone", where I think it is difficult for many elderly people and/or with psychomotor difficulties to be able to wear them properly. This is because finding the same "fishbone", which acts as a measurement hook, both on the left side and on the right side, may not be easy and intuitive for them. Another sore point, however, for the supports that take the entire upper part of the head, like a "ring", although thin, in the long run, I do not think them comfortable as well as being always very invasive and flashy.

## <a id="11"></a>Who is it aimed at?

This prototype is suitable for everyone: first of all, to the **healthcare personnel** engaged in emergencies and who, for many hours a day, must wear the *surgical mask*, secondly, to other categories of workers and, of course, to the **private citizen** who wears it every day, when he leaves home, to protect himself and others.

**For younger children, I recommend its use under adult supervision.**
